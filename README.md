# OneRaimol, version 0.1.49 (alpha)

Business system for [Rainchem International, Inc.](http://www.raimol.com).

Rainchem International Inc., (Raimol) has been present in the Lubricant Industry since 1995, an ISO Certified, Philippine-based Company that seeks to provide globally-competitive goods. With its 2 separated office locations, Parañaque and Taguig, transferring/communicating the essential data for production, the heart of the running this company, is that of demanding and long drawn out. The company is constantly finding ways to maximize the productivity through easy transportation of business details per transaction.

In line with this, the study aims to bring Rainchem International Inc., the concept of a Cloud Computing: Private and Public Application, focusing on the 3 services, namely, A. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, B. Platform-as-a-Service, and C. Software-as-a-Service. The whole scheme for server virtualization will only be centered on Software-as-a-Service Cloud Model, named OneRaimol.

OneRaimol will be utilized by the Rainchem International Inc., catering all the hardware infrastructure, software products and service, interacting with the client, using a Front-End Portal, centralizing all databases of all transactions needed for Middle-Management Service.

The purchasing, sales and inventory (data warehousing) and tracking databases shall provide Rainchem International Inc., the privilege to process the whole transaction through OneRaimol. As these 4 go hand in hand, OneRaimol allows the user to systematically complete the business deal, unlike the current process where everything is made in repetitive encoding of every detail in forms, such as sales report, sales order, purchase-work-order, production-batch-order, delivery report, and the like. 

Rainchem International Inc., a company which seeks for endless improvement, will now be facing the possibilities of having a Private (location of the cloud computing) – SaaS (Software-as-a-service) Application (service offered) Cloud, as the researchers propose an Inventory (Data Warehousing), Purchasing and Sales. This Private, Application Cloud for Rainchem International Inc., shall help the firm in taking another step ahead in terms of Business Computing, and eventually, will be called, the OneRaimol.
